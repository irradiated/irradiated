Hey! My name is Dakota, and I'm a Computer Science student, currently enrolled in a BSc in Computer Information Systems. I'm always looking for ways to expand my programming knowledge.

## My Interests

`🐧UNIX` and `💲Bash` are my favourite topics, but I also love `PHP`, `MySQL`, `C`, `Java`, and `Python`.

## My Hobbies

I really have too many, but they include ⌨️ custom keyboards, 
🖥️ computer hardware, 👾 video games (both new and old), and 
🎧 headphones.

In my spare time, I tend a herd of 4 guinea pigs! 🐹🐹🐹🐹
